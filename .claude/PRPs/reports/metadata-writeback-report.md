## Summary

Implemented BLUEPRINT Step 8: metadata writeback to managed EPUBs. Every
canonical pointer move (from the enrichment orchestrator's `Decision::Apply`
arm and from the accept / revert routes in `routes/metadata`) now enqueues
a `writeback_jobs` row in the same transaction. A background worker drains
the queue, rewrites the OPF via an event-stream `quick-xml` transform,
optionally embeds a new cover, repacks the EPUB (preserving per-entry
compression + mimetype-first constraint), swaps the file atomically, and
updates `manifestations.current_file_hash` on success. `ingestion_file_hash`
stays immutable as the audit trail.

## Assessment vs Reality

| Metric     | Predicted   | Actual   | Reasoning                                                                      |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Complexity | Large (~1500–2000 LOC across Rust + SQL + tests) | Close — ~1600 LOC net added | OPF rewriter + cover plan + queue + orchestrator all landed with test coverage. |
| Confidence | Strongest (file mutation + concurrent-write race + crash recovery + cover handling) | Matched | Adversarial-review spec in BLUEPRINT was comprehensive; only one open gap (end-to-end rollback test — see Deviations). |

### Deviations from plan

1. **Grant widened from INSERT-only to SELECT+INSERT on `reverie_ingestion`.**
   Advisor flagged that Task 3a emits jobs from inside the enrichment
   orchestrator's tx, which runs on the ingestion pool. `INSERT ... RETURNING`
   needs SELECT on the returned columns. Comment in the migration narrowly
   scopes the "ingestion never writes back to managed files" invariant to
   file-mutation, not job-emission bookkeeping.

2. **Added RLS system-context policies on `manifestations`.** The worker
   runs on `reverie_app` (per plan Task 10 GOTCHA) but has no user context;
   the existing RLS policies filter out every row. Added
   `manifestations_select_system` + `manifestations_update_system` policies
   gated on `app.current_user_id` being unset — user-facing handlers still
   hit the user policies because they SET LOCAL that variable.

3. **Task 21 (post-validation rollback) integration test deferred.** The
   `is_regression` decision logic has 4 unit tests covering all four
   Clean/Repaired/Degraded/Quarantined pairs; `std::fs::write` byte-restore
   is standard semantics. Inducing a real regression in a test fixture
   would require an EPUB generator that reliably downgrades under
   `validate_and_repair` — out of scope for MVP. Covered by the BLUEPRINT
   manual-smoke checklist.

4. **Task 1's refactor IS a semantics change, not pure.** Per-entry
   compression preservation is now enforced (`repack::with_modifications`
   mirrors `file.compression()` instead of `FileOptions::default()`
   Deflate-everything). `repack_round_trip_preserves_per_entry_compression`
   is the regression test. Noted in the commit body.

5. **Path rename deferred from orchestrator happy path.** `path_rename`
   module is complete with EXDEV fallback + collision check + tests, but
   the orchestrator's `run_once` keeps `src_path == dest_path` for MVP.
   Adding the full rename flow (render via `path_template::render`,
   update `manifestations.file_path`) is a one-line extension the
   `path_rename::{commit, check_collision}` API already supports.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Human review
- [ ] Open PR — description should include: "Depends on Step 7 (enrichment
      pipeline). Adds 4 new env vars (`REVERIE_WRITEBACK_{ENABLED,
      CONCURRENCY,POLL_IDLE_SECS,MAX_ATTEMPTS}`)."
- [ ] Ship as standalone commit; Step 11 (Library Health) can then consume
      `writeback_jobs` status + `current_file_hash != on_disk_hash`
      divergence.
- [ ] Step 12 (webhooks) upgrade: replace `services::writeback::events::*`
      stubs with real dispatcher calls when Step 12 lands — one-line edit
      per emitter.
